# Description

This file describes how users can be managed in HedgeDoc.

# Types

There are three types of user antries in HedgeDoc PostgreSQL database `Users` table.

* Registered users - When registration is open these update `email` field.
* GitHub OAuth users - When logged in they fill `profile` with JSON from GH.
* Google OAuth users - When logged in they also fill `profile`

We used to have open registrations, but those were closed.
Currently we only accept GitHub and Google logins.
